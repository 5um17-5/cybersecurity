## 1. Introduction

Honeypots are security mechanisms set to detect, deflect, or counteract attempts at unauthorized use of information systems. This documentation outlines the steps to set up and test a honeypot using a virtual environment consisting of Windows XP Professional and Kali Linux.

## 2. Objectives

- To set up a honeypot using Valhalla Honeypot application.
- To test the honeypot using Kali Linux.
- To monitor and analyze logs generated by the honeypot.

## 3. Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of virtual machines and networking.
- VirtualBox or VMware Workstation installed.
- Windows XP Professional ISO image.
- Kali Linux ISO image.
- Valhalla Honeypot application installer.

## 4. Environment Setup

### Virtual Machines

1. **Create Windows XP VM:**
   - Install VirtualBox or VMware Workstation.
   - Create a new VM and select Windows XP as the operating system.
   - Allocate at least 512 MB of RAM and 10 GB of hard disk space.
   - Install Windows XP Professional.

2. **Create Kali Linux VM:**
   - Create a new VM and select Linux as the operating system and Debian-based 64-bit.
   - Allocate at least 2 GB of RAM and 20 GB of hard disk space.
   - Install Kali Linux from the ISO image.

### Network Configuration

- **Bridge Networking:**
  - Configure both VMs to use bridged networking to allow them to communicate with each other and to have their own IP addresses on the local network.

## 5. Installation of Valhalla Honeypot

### On Windows XP

1. **Download and Install Valhalla Honeypot:**
   - Download the Valhalla Honeypot application installer from the official website.
   - Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

2. **Configure Valhalla Honeypot:**
   - Launch Valhalla Honeypot.
   - Configure the honeypot services (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SMB) as per the requirement.
   - Start the honeypot services and ensure they are running.

## 6. Testing the Honeypot

### Using Kali Linux

1. **Reconnaissance:**
   - Use tools like `nmap` to scan the network for the Windows XP VM.
     ```bash
     nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24
     ```
   - Identify the IP address of the Windows XP VM.

2. **Scanning:**
   - Perform a detailed scan on the identified IP address to discover open ports and services.
     ```bash
     nmap -sV -O 192.168.1.x
     ```

3. **Attack Simulation:**
   - Use tools like `hydra` for brute-force attacks on services like FTP or HTTP.
     ```bash
     hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ftp://192.168.1.x
     ```
   - Use `Metasploit` to exploit any known vulnerabilities.
     ```bash
     msfconsole
     use exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi
     set RHOST 192.168.1.x
     run
     ```

### Monitoring Logs

1. **Accessing Valhalla Logs:**
   - Open Valhalla Honeypot on Windows XP.
   - Navigate to the logs section to view the captured data.

2. **Analyzing Logs:**
   - Examine the logs for details of the attacks performed from Kali Linux.
   - Look for any suspicious activities, attempted exploits, and the interaction with the honeypot services.

## 7. Conclusion

Setting up a honeypot using Valhalla Honeypot on Windows XP and testing it with Kali Linux provides valuable insights into potential attack vectors and methodologies. Monitoring and analyzing the logs from the honeypot can help in understanding and improving the security posture of the network.

By following this documentation, you should be able to successfully set up and test a honeypot environment, providing a practical approach to enhancing network security through proactive threat detection and analysis.
